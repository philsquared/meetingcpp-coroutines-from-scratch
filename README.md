# meetingcpp-coroutines-from-scratch
Sample code from my Meeting C++ 2022 presentation, "C++ Coroutines, from scratch"


The actual code is on different branches - one for each evolution of the example:

* [serial](https://github.com/philsquared/meetingcpp-coroutines-from-scratch/tree/serial) for the initial serial (depth-first) version
* [batch](https://github.com/philsquared/meetingcpp-coroutines-from-scratch/tree/batch) for the batched version using lambda-based continuations
* [coroutines](https://github.com/philsquared/meetingcpp-coroutines-from-scratch/tree/coroutines) for the full coroutines version
* [generalized-batch](https://github.com/philsquared/meetingcpp-coroutines-from-scratch/tree/generalized-batch) I didn't get to show this in the talk, but this is a generalisation of the batched version that is a stepping stone towards coroutines
